## How to work on this project

### Software requirements

List of tools to be installed:

- IDE - we recommend [IntelliJ Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows)
- JDK 17 (can be downloaded by IntelliJ)
- Maven v3.9 - build tool (can be downloaded by IntelliJ and embedded in the repo `mvnw`)

### How to start developing

Clone the repo, and open it in IntelliJ. Select the correct SDK (JDK 17) in **File â†’ project structure**.

### How to run locally

#### Development server

Run `mvn spring-boot:run` for a dev server. This will open your browser on http://localhost:8080/. The app will
automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

#### Build

Run the below command to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the target/ directory.

```bash
mvnw package -Dmaven.test.skip -s settings.xml -q
```

The `target` folder including these three notable folders:

classes - The project compiled .class files.

reports - Reports produced by the build (such as test reports).

libs - Assembled project libraries (usually JAR and/or WAR files).

#### Test

Run the below command to test the project. It measuring code coverage in a code base and reporting it through visual
reports using JaCoCo. The test report will be stored in the `target/site` directory.

```bash
mvnw verify -s settings.xml -q
```

#### Deploy snapshots/releases

If you are running the pipeline of this project, we redefined the `upload-artifact` job as an example to show how you
can push the generated Maven artifacts into any maven repository (GitLab package registry, Nexus, SSG Artifactory, or
any other Maven repository).

Mandatory variables:

| variable                  | default value | description                                                                                                                        |
|---------------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| UPLOAD_RELEASES_REPO_URL  |               | (string) URL of your releases repository. Example: `https://innersource.soprasteria.com/projects/${CI_PROJECT_ID}/packages/maven`  |
| UPLOAD_SNAPSHOTS_REPO_URL |               | (string) URL of your snapshots repository. Example: `https://innersource.soprasteria.com/projects/${CI_PROJECT_ID}/packages/maven` |

Optional variables :

| variable                 | default value       | description                                          |
|--------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| UPLOAD_ARTIFACT_USERNAME | `${CI_DEPLOY_USER}` | (string) Username to login to your Maven repository. |
| UPLOAD_ARTIFACT_PASSWORD | `${CI_DEPLOY_USER}` | (string) Password to login to your Maven repository. |

If you are providing only `UPLOAD_XXX_REPO_URL` variables as input, this should correspond to the GitLab Maven package
registry of your project, because by default the job will use the credentials corresponding to this registry (this
requires to have created a [GitLab Deploy Token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/deploy_tokens/) with the scope
of `write_package_registry` beforehand).
To upload your Maven package into another repository, you'll have to provide `UPLOAD_XXX_REPO_URL` as well as the
credentials `UPLOAD_ARTIFACT_USERNAME` and `UPLOAD_ARTIFACT_PASSWORD` corresponding to the Maven repository you're
targeting.

You can also use the SSG Artifactory to push your artifacts. For more details regarding the SSG Artifactory, please
refer to [this page](https://steria.sharepoint.com/sites/intra_all_indus/SitePages/TOO-Artifactory--Overview.aspx).

## Recommended development workflow

With GitFlow, the main branch should always be releasable to production, and there should never be untested or
incomplete code on the main branch.

When using this Git workflow, no one commits to the main branch but rather uses a feature and fix branches. Feature and
fix branches are branches created by the developers to commit their modifications. Merge requests are then opened with
these branches as the source and targeting the main branch (or production branch if it is a hotfix).

Once the changes are merged to main branch, merge requests are then opened with this main branch as the source and
target the production branch

```mermaid
   gitGraph
      commit
      commit
      branch feature
      branch production
      checkout feature
      commit
      commit
      checkout main
      merge feature
      commit
      commit
      checkout production
      merge main
```

In short, we distinguish 4 types of branches:

| Branch                | Naming convention (prefix)             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Main branch(es)       | master,main,dev                        | The main branch contains the work done for the incoming release and is the base branch for any new feature or bug fix.<br>Your team should open merge requests targeting this branch when working on the project.<br>*There is usually a single main branch per project but if your team is developing several versions simultaneously then you can have versioned main branches, e.g. `main/vX.X.X`.*        |
| Test branches         | staging,pre-prod,qualif,qa,test        | Test branches are optional. They are useful when you have a Continuous Deployment pipeline that is able to create a new test/qualification environment on the fly.<br>In that case you can have as many test environment as necessary and you merge from one to another until the product is ready for production.                                                                                            |
| Production branch(es) | prod,rel                               | The production branch represents the version of your application currently deployed to production.<br>It is the base branch for any new hot fix that should quickly be shipped to production.<br>*There is usually a single production branch per project but if your team is maintaining several versions simultaneously then it is handy to have versioned release/production branches, e.g. `rel/vX.X.X`.* |
| Feature/Fix branches  | feat,ft,hotfix,fix,dependabot,renovate | Feature and fix branches are branches created by the developers to commit their modifications. Merge requests are then opened with these branches as the source and targeting the main branch (or production branch if it is a hotfix).<br>These branches must have a short lifespan, they must be integrated or deleted as fast as possible.                                                                 |

## How does the pipeline work

In this project, there is a CI/CD pipeline that covers code quality, unit testing, security scans and also deployment to
Openshift. We briefly introduce the role of each stages in pipeline below,

- init: does some initial checks before going further in the pipeline.
- build-application: builds (or promotes) the application artifacts (e.g. .war, .jar, .exe...).
- test-application: tests the application (this stage is optional as the tests can also be executed during the
  build-application stage).
- build-image: builds (or promotes) the application image from the Dockerfile present in the repo and the artifacts
  generated previously.
- analysis: runs some static analysis on the application (both security and lint/best practices).
- security-check: serves as a security gate based on the results of the static analysis done previously.
- deploy: deploys the application on an environment (test or production).
- pre-acceptance: prepares for the acceptance tests (for instance load some test data in a database).
- acceptance: executes the acceptance tests that will validate the application.
- performance: executes the performance tests that will validate the application.
- release: runs a set of actions when the application is released (i.e. merged to a production branch).
- destroy: defines a manual job that can be run to destroy a deployed environment (see deploy stage).
- .post: runs some specific actions at the end of the pipeline

## Security concerns

The DEP updates the original template regularly but you can not benefit automatically from the updates.

In all cases, the project is responsible for assessing and mitigating security issues on their repositories.

The OCI images used in [.gitlab-ci.yml](.gitlab-ci.yml) file are built from
the [dep/library/project-oci-images](dep/library/project-oci-images) repository. You can check periodically for
potential updates of these images.

## OAuth Proxy Authentication

Your application can be protected with an oauth-proxy side container. For more details, please refer to
the [DEP Documentation](https://docs.dep.soprasteria.com/docs/devsecops/oauth-proxy/)

## How to improve this template

This GitLab project template has been generated dynamically using [mustache templating](https://mustache.github.io/). If
you want to help the DEP team improve this template, please open an issue or a merge request
at [dep/library/dynamic-project-templates](https://innersource.soprasteria.com/dep/library/dynamic-project-templates).
